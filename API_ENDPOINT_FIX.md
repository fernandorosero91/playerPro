# API Endpoint Fix for Production Deployment

## Problem Identified
The application was deployed successfully on Render, but the frontend was still trying to connect to `localhost:5000` instead of the production URL, causing all API calls to fail with `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` errors.

## Root Cause
The `API_BASE` constant in `index.html` was hardcoded to `'http://localhost:5000'`, which works only in development but fails in production.

## Solution Implemented
Updated the API endpoint configuration to automatically detect the environment:

```javascript
// Auto-detect environment and set API base URL
const API_BASE = window.location.hostname === 'localhost' || window.location.hostname === '127.0.0.1' 
    ? 'http://localhost:5000' 
    : `${window.location.protocol}//${window.location.host}`;
```

This change ensures:
- **Development**: Uses `http://localhost:5000` when running locally
- **Production**: Uses the actual Render URL (e.g., `https://playerpro.onrender.com`)

## Files Modified
- `index.html` - Line 623: Updated API_BASE configuration

## Redeployment Instructions
1. Commit the changes to your repository
2. Push to the main branch
3. Render will automatically redeploy the application
4. Test the functionality once deployment is complete

## Expected Results After Fix
✅ YouTube search functionality will work  
✅ Playlist loading will work  
✅ Song upload functionality will work  
✅ Current track loading will work  
✅ All API endpoints will connect properly  

## Additional Notes
- The Tailwind CSS CDN warning is cosmetic and doesn't affect functionality
- The YouTube API will work properly once the backend endpoints are accessible
- No environment variables need to be changed on Render

## Testing
After redeployment, verify that:
1. The browser console shows no `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` errors
2. YouTube search returns results
3. Playlist functionality works
4. Song upload works properly
